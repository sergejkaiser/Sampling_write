The effects of age in 7 categories, income level in 3 categories and sex on having a stable general practitioner were studied. Dummy coding was used. The method of analysis is logistic regression. There are two analyses one taking the survey design into account and the other not. There were x units with variable values not available, they were deleted pairwise. 

Design effect a ratio of variances.

Here we will compare a regression equation where none of the design features were taken into account and a one where all of them (finite population correction, stratification, clustering, weighting, ) are taken into account.
