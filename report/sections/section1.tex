\section{Critical reading
The problem of nonrespone in sample survey
- first point sample size is only one factor of sampling error
- shows based on a variance formula that same reliability may arrise from various sample sizes
- shows optimal number of mails and in person interviews for a desired average error can be calculated if an approximate response rate is available.
- if the response rate is unkown the authors showed that the optimal number of mails and in person interviews can be obtained for a given range of reponse rates.
-  further highlighted two alternatives to acheive minimum cost for a desired avg. level of precision (for a response rate of 100\% assuming similarity between respondents and non respondents ).
- Alternative 1 initially send out 1000 mails and follow up interviews for all non respones.  Higher cost than optimal combination, for repsonse rate >30, cost increase from 10 to 24 percemt
- Alternative 2 preferable if approximate reponse is unkown, specify maximum number of responss sent out. Second step after sample return and response rate is known, set in person interviews such taht desired level of precision is achieved
- Striking result for alternative 2 even though reponse rate not known, for a given level of precision may be reached for low level of cost (not much higher than optimal level of cost).
